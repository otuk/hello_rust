'std' is the identifier for the standard rust crate that comes with rust by default. Any rust project can use the std crate without the need for the import statement which otherwise would  be needed to import a foreign crate : `extern crate std` In the std crate there quite a few parts called modules.  One of them is the std::env module that helps you access the environment of your program.   To use env we need the following line: `use std::env; mod point;` Besides the foreign crates, your project code can have different modules. In the above line you can see how to access the point module from the main.rs file that we are in. It enables access to the public contents of the point.rs file which is in the same directory."]]});
